# Enhanced-Guess
Guessing game where user guesses a number between 1 and a max value of their choosing

The application prompts the user until a valid entry is given. (A number > 0).
Once a max value is given, the program generates a random number between 1 and that max value. The user is then supposed to try to guess that number.

All invalid guesses will display error messages explaining why the guesses are invalid.

The application lets the user know if their guesses are higher or lower than the randomly generated number. If a number is guessed twice, the user will be told that they already guessed that number.
All valid guesses are kept track of and will be made known to the user upon completion.
